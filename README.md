Udacity Project 2 &amp; 3 : Data visualization Nanodegree.

Project 2 - Dashboards course midterm project
Design a dashboard for a specific audience which you’ll define by their graphicacy, data literacy, domain expertise, user type (frequent/infrequent), metrics that matter most and any other attributes that might influence the design. This dashboards’ main purpose is to ensure the appropriate data has been chosen for decisions needing to be made. Students will use the Superstore dataset from Tableau for this project.

Project 3 - Dashboards course final project
In this project, students will make the dashboard truly insightful by adding design elements that draw the user’s eye to points of interest based on data. Students will transform their visualizations to emphasize the most important points of interests and add interactivity further facilitating the users desired actions.
